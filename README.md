Interactive point group flowchart

# This is free-to-use software.

A lot of information about a molecule can be determined from its symmetry group.
This is a simple flowchart for determining the point group representation of
any molecule. That being said, this is only a step to determining the irreducible
representations and calculating the orbital energy (includiing HOMO and LUMO orbital)
levels. I will add to this file as I include those determinations/calculations. Enjoy.
